R codes used in the present study

1-habtools.R: extracts morphological traits from .obj files;

2-Exploratory analyses: Gets log-ratio of each morphological trait, log-transform variables;

3a-mixed models: tests for the effect of light treatment on the log-ratio of each morphological trait via linear mixed models;

3b-intergroup differences: Makes distribution boxplots for each morphological trait, ANOVAs between C0 and S0 groups, correlation plot of each variable two by two;

4a-Reflectance: plots reflectance profiles;

4b-pigments: compares pigment concentrations;

5a-ITS2 rarefy and transform: rarefies raw ITS2 data to same amount of reads for each individual, transforms data from long format to community format;

5b-ITS2_stacked_column_plots: makes stacked column plots of symbiont clades for each treatment and genotype;

6-PCA: performs multivariate statistics on morphological trait data, makes PCA plot, and gets distance and angles between paired PCA points.
