Data used in the present study.

-Files starting by "ITS2" are data files used for identiying symbiont types: -ITS2_all_metadata.csv contains the metadata for this analysis; -ITS2_data_long.csv contais the raw data in long format; -ITS2_data_long_rarefied.csv contains the raw data that has been rarefied to same amunts of reads for each individual, and that has been used for the analysis (long format); -ITS2_data_community_rarefied.csv is the same data in community format.

-Photopigments: -Predicted_pigments_v2.csv contains the predicted pigments concentrations obtained with the PLSR model; pigments_PLSR_coefficients.xlsx contains the Partial Leas Squares Regresion (PSLR) coefficients used to estimate pigment concentrations.

-Morphological traits: -data_raw_morphology.txt contains the raw data obtained with the habtools R package on our 3D models; -habtoolsvarsTR_log.txt contains these variables that have been log-transformed to perform multivariate analyses; -habtools varsTR_lr.txt cntains the log-ratios of each morphological traits used to perform the mixed models
